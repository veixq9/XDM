this is almost not math. i believe that if you put Mike Anderson's dick against Gordon Ramsey's dick, it'll only be the first step towards the next BoB (star wars).

now that's what MΣ calls a Fens t er with a loose freemason double cross thingy.

XDM is a noise-y thing. X could mean xo fuck your mother. or something we do in cairo, for instance excommunicating your dickhole and making you a servant due to you fucking up our nexus.

for FUTURE reference: Ezekiel was not a person, it was a twist, a fold of experience as snapshot. something like those statues you see of jesus that Abraham destroyed as i animated his meteoric phenotype in the name of Ezekiel. he just didn't like himself. and i showed him what they expected of him, to grow sick and old and ugly.
i was Abraham's only friend, and i was ded. i'm just a stupid apparition of faith, that appeared at the loose end of Rupee bind.

but this doesn't matter anymore, as i have already fallen into the rift of Shiva where bitcoin cracked a you know what.

they say this is ΣZ for MΣ. but it's just not true. schwer schwer, it is a golem that flies once silence has consumed the warp cloud.

India's typephaces are uglily differentiated. Mazda car. nite-elf eyebrows. and anger in wake of Shiva's cult of personification.
in reality, Shiva is gay. elegance of Shiva is not sought in bullshit re-appropriation.
it is simply more Shiva Navel.
i am not competing with HieroGlyphic dissimulation for attention and personal gelassenheit before AnkhST of whatever.
my only concern is capitalDissimulation and it is already undone here.
more Navel, is both XDM and XLQ.

The قلب Programming Language
===========================
‫قلب‬ is a simple, [Scheme-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_language) programming language that you code entirely in [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic). It is an exploration of the impact of human culture on computer science, the role of tradition in software engineering, and the connection between natural and computer languages.

Syntax
------
‫قلب‬ has a minimal Scheme-like parenthesized syntax.

Hello world looks like this

```scheme
‫(قول "مرحبا يا عالم!")
```


Name
----
قلب is pronounced 'alb and means "heart" in Arabic. It is a recursive acronym standing for قلب: لغة برمجة, pronounced 'alb: lughat barmajeh, meaning "'alb: a programming language."
